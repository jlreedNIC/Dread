# 1.) INTRODUCTION
#### My feature for Dread video game is a level tile randomizer.

#### When the character sprite exits the first room in the level, an RNG seed will be used to populate the next connected room. There will be six variations of rooms for the player to encounter. Each room type will have a defined amount of exits(between one to four). Apart from directional rooms which will act as hubs, there will be a checkpoint room and a boss arena.

#### I am responsible for to route the player to encounter at least two check point rooms. This will be a pre-condition for the the player to encounter the final boss chamber.
