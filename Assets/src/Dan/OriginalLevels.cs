 * levels permutations would be pushed and popped from memory during game runtime
 * IE as the player exits a previous room, the room is popped from the vector.
 *  
 * after the first checkpoint room was encountered a virtual function would evaluate the state
 * and replace the class with the desert tile prefabs and use that populated array
