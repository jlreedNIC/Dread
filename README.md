- As long as Unity doesn't generate any compilation errors, you can move onto building. <br />
- Click on "file" in the top left corner of the unity editor, then click "Build & Run". <br />
- Unity will automatically compile everything into the necessary files and create one convenient Pong application file that you can click on whenever you would like to   play. Note Unity creates several other files and folders that must be in the same directory of the Pong application for the game to run. <br />
